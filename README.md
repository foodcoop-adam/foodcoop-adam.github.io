Foodsoft@NL documentation website
=================================

This is the source for http://foodcoop-adam.github.io/ , the user and foodcoop
documentation website for the Dutch Foodsoft fork.

Please feel free to add and improve this :)

For PDFs and images, we try to keep the sources here as well. To export multi-page
SVGs in Inkscape, you can use the plugin [found here](https://github.com/wvengen/inkscape-addons).


Developer docs
--------------

This repo is also abused to contain [developer documentation](https://github.com/foodcoop-adam/foodcoop-adam.github.io/tree/developer-docs).
