General development documents
=============================

This is a vault for documents that may be useful to have for developers.  It
contains mockup ideas, reports, notes, artwork, etc.

If you have the idea that something would be good to keep for the future, take
a moment to think where to put it, and commit. Do link from relevant places
in the wiki, for example.

If something is truly outdated, feel free to remove it (there's still a copy in
git anyway). It's more useful to have relevant info than to retain everything.
